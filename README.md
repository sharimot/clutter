# Do not use Notion

A live app is worth a thousand words.
Try [this online demo](https://bafybeidxtdnmd6gw7l2dmgbnl6thkrpjhrs2u6x32obdj3dhbw5ylb57wq.ipfs.dweb.link/) and you'll see why using Notion is a waste of time.
If you want a faster version of this app, download the latest release by running:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sharimot/clutter
```

and start running the app by clicking the `clutter` executable inside the `clutter` directory.
You can negate a keyword by prefixing it with `-`.
Also, you can tag a word by prefixing it with `#`.
If you have any questions, please feel free to let me know through the GitHub issues.
I hope you enjoy the world of Clutter!
